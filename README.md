**This is a basic project doing simple CRUD operations with Angular6 structure and material design feature with an external nodejs api. It uses Angular-cli.
(There might be some gitlab-CI and heroku depoyment related code chunks which you could ommit)**

**Though there are no documentation, I hope this could be of much use for beginners.
